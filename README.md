👋 Hi there! I'm Payam, a front-end developer and enthusiast. I'm passionate about designing and coding modern, beautiful web experiences that delight users.

🤓 I have a keen interest in both the technical side of coding, think algorithms and clean code .

🎨 but that doesnt stop me from loving creativity and dance of colors and waves in a colorful and beautiful design! 

 When I'm not coding, you can find me sleeping in my bed 🛌
 
 Let's connect and build something awesome together! 🚀💻🎨
