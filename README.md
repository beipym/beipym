👋 Hi there! I'm Payam, a front-end developer and enthusiast. I'm passionate about designing and coding modern, beautiful web experiences that delight users.\
🤓 I have a keen interest in both the technical side of coding, think algorithms and clean code .\
🎨 but that doesnt stop me from loving creativity and dance of colors and waves in a colorful and beautiful design!\ 
When I'm not coding, you can find me dreaming about coding or dreaming about launching some startup 🧑‍🚀
